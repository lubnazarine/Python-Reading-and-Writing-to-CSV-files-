"""Which of the following is true about unpacking values into variables when reading rows of a CSV file? 
(Check all that apply)



We need the same amount of variables as there are columns of data in the CSV 

Correct
Awesome! We need to have the exact same amount of variables on the left side of the equals sign as the length of the sequence on the right side when unpacking rows into individual variables.


Rows can be read using both csv.reader and csv.DictReader

Correct
Right on! Although they read the CSV rows into different datatypes, both csv.reader or csv.DictReader can be used to parse CSV files.


An instance of the reader class must be created first

Correct
Nice job! We have to create an instance of the reader class we are using before we can parse the CSV file.
